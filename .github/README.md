## Feature requests

## Getting Started 
Yes, in its current state this process is _tedious_. However, there will be an installer in the future that will make getting started much simpler.

#### Important:
Currently the Miki API is __private__, meaning you won't have access to the leaderboards until the API is released publicly. More information will be available [here](https://github.com/mikibot/miki/wiki/API-Leaderboards) when that happens.

If you have any questions about the setup process **do not** ask in the support server, as a majority of the people there will not be able to assist you. DM Xetera#9596 for questions instead.

## Installation Steps:
1. Clone the miki bot repository

Windows, Linux
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/mikibot/bot
```

2) Download [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and set up a database called `Miki`.

3) Copy `launchSettings.template.json` and fill in your PostgreSQL properties.
```bash
$ cp src/Miki/Properties/launchSettings.template.json src/Miki/Properties/launchSettings.json
```

4) Set your bot token through `psql` to insert your configuration in dbo."Configuration"

5) Run Miki. ðŸŽ‰

## Possible issues:
These will likely be fixed in the near future (if it's not already by the time you're reading this):

* A lack of API keys might be giving you issues in the `DonatorModule` and `FunModule`, the simplest way to solve it is to just comment out the lines that raise exceptions and  the lines that reference the client **(there shouldn't be more than 2 reference max, if so, you're doing something wrong).**

* If you're having trouble running migrations make sure your `EntityFramework` for both base `Miki` and `Miki.Framework` is on version 2.0.1-2.0.3 **NOT** 2.1.1.
